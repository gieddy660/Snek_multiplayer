Each player is represented by:
    - hash id (8 bytes)
    note: hash id must be unique


Flow of the game:
    - players registers to the server
    - player sends commands and queries to the server to get status and set data about itself
    - player dies


Commands:
    0 register to server
    1 set direction
    2 get game info
    3 get current state
    4 get updated state
    254 get current state (old mode)
    255 get updated state (old mode)


Client message format:
0 ->

2 ->
    | 2 |

3 ->
    | 3 (| player hash id )|  (see note 2)

254 -> sends current state in old mode, meaning it only sends blocks and if the player is alive:
    - alive (1 byte)

    - number of blocks (4 bytes)
    - 0 (4 bytes)
    for each block:
        - x coordinate (2 bytes)
        - y coordinate (2 bytes)


255 -> sends updated state in of the game in old mode, meaning it only sends old and new blocks and if the player is alive:
    - alive (1 byte)

    - number of new blocks (4 bytes)
    - number of old blocks (4 bytes)
    - for each block
        - x coordinate (2 bytes)
        - y coordinate (2 bytes)

Notes:
(1) All numbers are big endian.

(2) For commands 3 and 254 hash id of a player is optional. If not given the server sends a dummy player
    that should be ignored.

(3) Differently to command 4 the only objects to be sent are the ones alive right now, so if an object
    dies between two adjacent messages the server doesn't communicate it directly. Therefore the client
    should discard current state of the game every time it uses this command.
    es:
    message 1: A B C
    meanwhile B dies and D joins
    message 2: A C D
    (note that the server doesn't directly communicate identity of an object so the client can't effectively
    know that the second object sent is now C rather than B)

(4) Objects of each type are sent in order, so that the first object sent in two following messages is
    the same object, and the same applies for the second, third, ans so on. If an object is to be deleted
    the server will still send it in the following message marking it as dead. It will not be sent in
    subsequent messages. Objects that are to be added will be added at the bottom of the list.
    es:
    message 1: A B C
    message 2: A B C D
    message 3: A B.dead C D
    message 4: A C D

(5) While data is sent as ascii, the strings it contains may contain unicode. Unicode characters are escaped
    with \x \u or \U  (see python ascii builtin function or json.dump function).
